                            I am 27 years old and from San Diego, CA. Specifically, I am from Encinitas, a small beach
                            town in Northern San Diego County. Growing up I spent most of my free time surfing and
                            exploring San Diego with friends. As I've grown, I have picked up some new hobbies, though,
                            surfing is still my favorite of them. My new hobbies include traveling, playing music,
                            and coding. Check out the <a class="link-info" href="#hobbies">Hobbies</a> section for more info on what
                            define me outside of&nbsp;work.
                            <br><br>
                            Currently, I live in Santa Barbara, CA. I resigned from my previous job in late 2022
                            to pursue a career pivot towards software development. I have been building a
                            <a class="link-info" href="#work">Portfolio</a> of projects which I highlight below.
                            Additionally, check out the <a class="link-info" href="#pivot">Pivot</a> section for more
                            details about&nbsp;this.
                            <br><br>
                            While I pursue this pivot, I am working at my favorite wine bar & tap house - Corks & Crowns.
                            I was a member here before working here, which made for an easy transition from
                            in front of the bar to behind it. I truly appreciate my time spent here as I have formed
                            meaningful friendships with coworkers and regulars&nbsp;alike.

                                    Leather Bound Webpages is a personal blog I developed for my self. This was
                                    a <i>two birds with one stone</i> opportunity where I wanted to start a blog and
                                    also wanted to develop a dynamic website using the Flask framework. I
                                    created this blog to share introspective thoughts woven into life
                                    experiences. I found myself journaling these kinds of entries and thinking,
                                    "I wish I could share these," and thus the motivation to create a blog
                                    arose. That motivation coincided with wanting to learn one of Python's web
                                    frameworks and learn how to deploy web applications. For more technical

                                    During my 3+ year tenure at ManTech International's
                                    Environmental Range and Sustainability Services division, I was trusted to wear many hats.
                                    Initially, I was mainly tasked with researching environmental resources and authoring
                                    technical documents regarding them. My favorite work from this time was
                                    modeling air quality emissions and authoring Air Quality resource chapters for
                                    commercial rocket launch operations - including documents for FireFly and&nbsp;Phantom.
                                    <br><br>
                                    About 1 year into my tenure at ManTech I was offered a position as a GIS Engineer
                                    with an emphasis on developing backend Python scripts to support my team's in-the-field
                                    efforts. I quickly proved that I had what it took to adapt to the role and lead
                                    quickly. Within a few months I was leading my team's analysis efforts, and supporting
                                    those efforts with software tools that increased report efficiency and quality.
                                    These tools helped expedite our proprietary analysis while also facilitating seamless
                                    integration between local and cloud&nbsp;environments.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Additionally, I was also placed on a separate team who's chief responsibility was
                                    managing 5 public facing Navy websites. This frontend centered role involved working
                                    with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a content management framework - Dot Net Nuke - to
                                    orchestrate the release of federal announcements and documents to the&nbsp;public.

                            Ever since I was a child, I have had a knack for building. My grandpa was teaching me how to
                            use scroll saws, sanders, and drills when I was in preschool. Despite my Mom not feeling
                            comfortable with me potentially loosing a finger before I could write a sentence, my
                            grandpa ensured me with his knowledge and trust, and helped me realize my love
                            for&nbsp;building.
                            <br><br>
                            When I started college, I declared my major as Mechanical Engineering but became disillusioned
                            with the path I was on after a couple years. I loved the math and science, finding a knack
                            for these as well while setting the curve in several Physics and Calculus courses.
                            However, as I began taking classes focused on Mechanical Engineering, I felt uninspired. I
                            went to engineering fairs at an attempt to stoke this inspiration and all I thought was,
                            "Do I really want to spend my career engineering springs that optimizes a mechanical
                            component 1.5% in some arbitrary&nbsp;metric?"
                            <br><br>
                            I discussed this with classmates, friends, and academic advisors, and found myself driven
                            towards Environmental Science, since I could continue with math and science courses while
                            simultaneously aligning my career with something I am passionate about, the&nbsp;environment.
                            <br><br>
                            I graduated, landed my job at ManTech - an environmental consulting firm -
                            and began my professional career. Quickly I found I preferred
                            working on things involving, you guessed it, math and science. I gravitated towards modeling
                            air emissions and analyzing datasets via SQL tools which was recognized by my&nbsp;superiors.
                            <br><br>
                            After about a year at ManTech, I was promoted to a GIS Engineer & Python developer. I
                            discuss this in a bit more detail <a class="link-info" href="#mantech">above</a>, and also
                            in my <a class="link-info" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQbg1x6YXd3SC_ujDoDRfBQSqMFt_2lNTtTqlwTTGlq38Bd3u2AxyCBhLcAl6i1lm1TnUgJxYrgYjcm/pub" target="_blank"><nobr>resume<i class="fa-solid fa-square-up-right"></i></nobr></a>.
                            During my 2 years in this position, I grew a strong foundation in both backend development with Python
                            and frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained experience with
                            machine learning, working across cloud environments, leading analysis directives on my team, and so on. More
                            importantly though, I found true inspiration in my work as I was working within the analytical
                            context I grew fond of on college while also using software to do what I have loved since
                            childhood,&nbsp;building.
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, I recognized a glass ceiling in my role and this was even corroborated by my
                            superiors. They had plenty of work for me, but the niche of the role only required so many
                            skills and I had reached the limit; I had stagnated. I could continue writing Python
                            scripts; or I could purse the much broader world of software&nbsp;development.
                            <br><br>
                            At this point, I was confident it was time for me to resign, find a side-job to make ends
                            meet, and pursue a more pure form of software development. I have been self-taught since day
                            1 of my development career and knew I had the discipline and capacity to achieve my goal. To
                            this day, I am developing <a class="link-info" href="#work">full-stack projects</a>, reading
                            articles, and taking certificate courses to learn what is necessary to complete this&nbsp;pivot.
                            <br><br>
                            I am excited for this next chapter to begin at a company I am excited about. I have no doubt
                            I will integrate into my new team well and be a teammate that others enjoy collaborating with.
                            Through software development I have found a way to leverage my love for building in a context
                            that I am truly inspired by. I still love building and tinkering with my hands, but building software
                            and understanding their components has ignited a new inspiration for building. I am grateful
                            to have found software development and can not wait to see where it takes me in my&nbsp;career.
